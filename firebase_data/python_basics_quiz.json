    {
      "id": "q1",
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "question": "Which of the following is the correct way to create a variable in Python?",
      "options": [
        "var name = \"John\"",
        "name = \"John\"",
        "string name = \"John\"",
        "name := \"John\""
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "In Python, you assign values to variables using the equals sign (=). No variable declaration or type specification is needed."
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "question": "What will this code print? x = 5; y = 2; print(x + y)",
      "options": [
        "5 + 2",
        "7",
        "52",
        "Error"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "The + operator adds two numbers together. 5 + 2 equals 7."
    },
    {
      "id": "q3",
      "type": "true_false",
      "question": "In Python, indentation is optional and only used for readability.",
      "correct_answer": false,
      "explanation": "In Python, indentation is mandatory and used to define code blocks. Incorrect indentation will result in IndentationError."
    },
    {
      "id": "q4",
      "type": "code_completion",
      "question": "Complete the code to print all numbers from 1 to 5 using a for loop:",
      "code_template": "for i in range(___, ___):\n    print(i)",
      "correct_answer": "1, 6",
      "explanation": "range(1, 6) generates numbers from 1 up to (but not including) 6, which gives us 1, 2, 3, 4, 5."
    },
    {
      "id": "q5",
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "question": "How do you check if a variable x equals 5 in a conditional statement?",
      "options": [
        "if x = 5:",
        "if x == 5:",
        "if x === 5:",
        "if equals(x, 5):"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "In Python, the equality comparison operator is ==. The single = is used for assignment, not comparison."
    },
    {
      "id": "q6",
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "question": "Which loop type would be best for iterating through a list of items?",
      "options": [
        "do-while loop",
        "repeat-until loop",
        "for loop",
        "switch loop"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 2,
      "explanation": "In Python, a for loop is designed to iterate over sequences like lists, tuples, and strings, making it perfect for processing collections of items."
    },
    {
      "id": "q7",
      "type": "code_completion",
      "question": "Complete the code to define a function that returns the sum of two numbers:",
      "code_template": "def add_numbers(a, b):\n    _______ a + b",
      "correct_answer": "return",
      "explanation": "The 'return' keyword is used to specify the value that a function should output when called."
    },
    {
      "id": "q8",
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "question": "What will the following code print? fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']; print(fruits[1])",
      "options": [
        "apple",
        "banana",
        "cherry",
        "Error"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "List indexing in Python starts at 0, so fruits[0] is 'apple' and fruits[1] is 'banana'."
    },
    {
      "id": "q9",
      "type": "true_false",
      "question": "The statement 'break' is used to skip the current iteration and continue with the next one in a loop.",
      "correct_answer": false,
      "explanation": "The 'break' statement exits the loop entirely. It's the 'continue' statement that skips the current iteration and moves to the next one."
    },
    {
      "id": "q10",
      "type": "code_completion",
      "question": "Complete the while loop that prints numbers from 1 to 5:",
      "code_template": "count = 1\nwhile count <= ___:\n    print(count)\n    count += 1",
      "correct_answer": "5",
      "explanation": "The condition 'count <= 5' ensures the loop continues until count reaches 5, printing numbers 1 through 5."
