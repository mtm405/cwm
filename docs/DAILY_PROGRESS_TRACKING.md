## ‚è±Ô∏è **TIME TRACKING**

### **Phase 1 Estimates:**
- Progress Persistence: 4-6 hours
- Progress Bar Fix: 2-3 hours
- Testing & Polish: 1-2 hours
- **Total Phase 1**: 7-11 hours

### **Daily Time Log:**
**Day 1**: 6 hours spent ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- Task: Assessment-based progress tracking implementation
- Issues encountered: None - smooth implementation
- Completed: [x] Yes [ ] No

**MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS:**
- ‚úÖ Fixed progress persistence with enhanced API integration
- ‚úÖ Implemented comprehensive assessment-based progress tracking
- ‚úÖ Created test validation system for all assessment types
- ‚úÖ Updated backend models and API endpoints
- ‚úÖ Enhanced frontend with assessment validation logic

**Day 2**: ___ hours spent  
- Task: ________________
- Issues encountered: ________________
- Completed: [ ] Yes [ ] No

## üîç **IMMEDIATE DEBUGGING CHECKLIST**

### **Before Starting Development:**
- [ ] Create branch: `git checkout -b fix/lesson-progress-overhaul`
- [ ] Run Flask app and test current progress system
- [ ] Open browser dev tools ‚Üí Network tab
- [ ] Navigate to a lesson and try completing a block
- [ ] Document what API calls are currently being made (if any)

### **Progress Persistence Investigation:**
- [ ] Check if `/api/lessons/{id}/progress` GET endpoint works
- [ ] Check if `/api/lessons/{id}/complete-block` POST endpoint works  
- [ ] Test with Postman/Thunder Client if needed
- [ ] Identify where the frontend should be calling these APIs

### **Frontend Investigation:**
- [ ] Find `LessonProgress.saveProgress()` method location
- [ ] Find `markBlockComplete()` method location
- [ ] Check what happens when "Mark as Complete" button is clicked
- [ ] Verify if localStorage is being used as fallback

## üö® **CRITICAL ISSUES TO SOLVE**

### **Issue 1: Progress Not Persisting**
**Current Behavior**: Progress resets on page reload  
**Expected Behavior**: Progress persists across sessions  
**Investigation**: 
- [ ] Check network calls when completing blocks
- [ ] Verify backend API endpoints are functional
- [ ] Find where progress should be saved/loaded

### **Issue 2: Progress Bar Shows 0%**  
**Current Behavior**: Always shows 0% even with completed blocks  
**Expected Behavior**: Shows actual completion percentage  
**Investigation**:
- [ ] Check progress calculation formula
- [ ] Verify completed_blocks array is populated
- [ ] Check if UI is reading the correct data

### **Issue 3: Topics Not Displayed**
**Current Behavior**: Linear block display  
**Expected Behavior**: Topic/section navigation  
**Investigation**:
- [ ] Check lesson data structure in Firebase
- [ ] See if topic information exists in lesson data
- [ ] Check template rendering logic

## ‚úÖ **COMPLETION CRITERIA**

### **Phase 1 Complete When:**
- [x] Complete a lesson block ‚Üí reload page ‚Üí block still completed
- [x] Progress bar shows correct percentage based on completed blocks
- [x] Network tab shows successful API calls to save progress
- [x] Error handling works when network is unavailable
- [x] All existing functionality still works
- [x] **BONUS:** Assessment-based completion validation implemented

### **Ready for Phase 2 When:**
