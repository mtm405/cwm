# Archive Index - Complete Legacy File Organization

This index documents all legacy files that have been moved to the archive directory as part of the project cleanup process.

## File Categories

### Safely Archived
These files are no longer needed for active development but are kept for historical reference:

- **CSS Backups**: Old CSS backup directories from the modernization process
- **Development Scripts**: One-time use scripts that have completed their purpose
- **Legacy Templates**: Previous versions of HTML templates
- **Migration Tools**: Transitional helper files used during configuration migration
- **Template Files**: Deprecated template files that caused conflicts
- **Empty Files**: Files that were created but never used

### Archive Rationale

1. **css_backup_* directories**: Older backups superseded by newer versions
2. **dev_scripts/**: Scripts that were used for one-time migrations or fixes
3. **legacy/ files**: Previous versions of files that have been modernized
4. **migration helpers**: Transitional tools no longer needed after migration completion
5. **templates-deprecated/**: Deprecated template files that caused script loading conflicts
6. **unused/ files**: Empty files that served no purpose

## Safe Deletion Guidelines

### Ready for Deletion (after 3+ months of stable operation)
- `archive/unused/` - Empty files with no content
- Older backup directories (keeping only the most recent)

### Keep Indefinitely
- `archive/legacy/` - Historical reference for troubleshooting
- `archive/dev_scripts/` - May be useful for future similar operations

## Recovery Information

If any archived file is needed for recovery:
1. Check this index to locate the file
2. Copy (don't move) from archive to active directory
3. Update imports/references as needed
4. Test thoroughly before removing from archive

## Archive Statistics

- **Total files archived**: ~15+ files and directories
- **Space saved in root**: Significantly improved project navigation
- **Historical coverage**: June 2025 cleanup and migration process
- **Recovery status**: All archived files can be restored if needed
